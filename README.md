# Warehouse Management System - COM5043

A Java-based, menu-driven Warehouse Management System built as part of the COM5043 Software Engineering coursework. This application allows you to manage suppliers, products, inventory, customer orders, purchase orders, and financial tracking — all via a text-based interface.

## Features

- **Product Management**: Add and view products with low stock alerts
- **Supplier Management**: Add, view, and track supplier details and their order history
- **Purchase Orders**: Create and receive supplier purchase orders, automatically updating inventory and recording expenses
- **Customer Orders**: Create multi-item customer orders, process them against inventory, and track revenue
- **Financial Reporting**: Track revenue, expenses, and calculate net income
- **Receipt & History Viewing**: View receipts for individual customer orders and supplier purchase history
- **Automated Testing**: JUnit 5 tests follow the Arrange–Act–Assert pattern to ensure reliability

## Technologies Used

- Java 11
- Maven (for build and dependency management)
- JUnit 5 (for testing)

## GitHub File Naming Issue (IMPORTANT: READ BEFORE RUNNING SYSTEM)
```
Note: GitHub may store Supplier.java as Supplier.Java (capital .J).
This may cause errors like Supplier cannot be resolved to a type on case-sensitive systems.

To fix: manually rename Supplier.Java to Supplier.java if necessary.
```

## How to Run the Application

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open a terminal in the project root
3. Compile and run the program:

```
mvn compile
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="wms.Main"
```

> You may need to configure the exec plugin in `pom.xml` if not already done.

---

## How to Run Tests

Tests are written using JUnit 5 and follow the AAA (Arrange–Act–Assert) pattern.

```
mvn test
```

Expected output:
```
Tests run: 46, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
BUILD SUCCESS
```

## Testing Summary

- `ProductTest` — Tests restocking, price, and low-stock logic
- `CustomerOrderTest` — Tests product addition and total calculation
- `PurchaseOrderTest` — Tests price calculation and status updates
- `WarehouseManagerTest` — Tests core workflow like processing and receiving orders
- `FinancialReportTest` — Tests revenue/expense tracking and net income calculation

---

## Reflection

This system demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming principles:
- **Encapsulation** via private fields and accessors
- **Inheritance & Polymorphism** with the abstract `Order` superclass
- **Responsibility Separation** between manager, domain, and data classes

All functionality was designed based on assignment requirements and tested for accuracy.
